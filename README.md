### In N-dimensional Y.Neo Graph, the number of points in the graph is 5 to the N-th power, and the maximum distance between two points is 2N. It is a symmetric graph with only 2N edges connected to each point (and is still the best in the world).
### From the perspective of N-1, N-2,..., 2 dimensions, adjacent parent node groups of each dimension of points are connected by a Petersen diagram (thus, the distance between each dimension group is 2).
